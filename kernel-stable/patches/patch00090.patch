+	help
+	  On revisions of the PL310 prior to r3p2, the Store Buffer does
+	  not automatically drain. This can cause normal, non-cacheable
+	  writes to be retained when the memory system is idle, leading
+	  to suboptimal I/O performance for drivers using coherent DMA.
+	  This option adds a write barrier to the cpu_idle loop so that,
+	  on systems with an outer cache, the store buffer is drained
+	  explicitly.
